        When I was a child, I passed by a drugstore. The couplet on the door read, "I just wish there would be no disease in the world, why worry about the medicine on the shelf staining the dust?"

        The greatest thing about this movie is that the rich actually did nothing wrong. Their husbands and wives are loving, they have happy children, there is no cheating, no cold violence, no child abuse, and they are generous and not stingy to their drivers and servants. They They are really kind and simple, but you just can't help but hate them, hate them, hate them.

        I use my sleepy fantasies to fill the boring gap. I have been mediocre for many years, but I don’t know that one day I will abandon the old routine and practice traveling far away to encounter the beauty of the world. From Greenland to Iceland to the Himalayas, the scenery is majestic and full of contagion. People who have experiences and stories will have a new state of mind towards life and love. The warm and inspiring movie chicken soup always gives people an illusory feeling of fullness.
